# Odin Project Rails Blog

This is the first Ruby on Rails project I did for the Odin Project.

It's a very simple blog which allows visitors to view posts and comments. Creating, editing and deleting content requires authentication by means of hardcoded credentials.

Since it wasn't really the point of this project, I didn't bother to add any styling. I would have liked to do the authentication in a more elegant way, but I'm sure that will be the topic of future lessons.
